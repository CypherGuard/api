- The server encrypt with AES-256 the password
- The server store the encrypted password in the database

## How password retrieval work

- The server decrypt the password with AES-256
- The server encrypt the password with the public key of the user
- The server send the encrypted password to the user
- The user decrypt the password with his private key
- The user get the password
